shortDescription: "A Java project with a graphical user interface, designed using Figma."
longDescription: "My first project is an application I developed as part of my studies using Java. The goal of the project was to create a user-friendly desktop application, with the GUI design created in Figma beforehand. Using Figma allowed me to design a modern and appealing interface, which I then implemented in Java. During development, I gained valuable experience in designing and implementing graphical user interfaces in Java, and learned how to combine design and programming effectively. This project helped me deepen my Java development skills and apply the design process with Figma in practice. Overall, I am very satisfied with the result and look forward to further developing the project and adding new features."
