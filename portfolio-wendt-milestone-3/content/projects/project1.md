shortDescription: "A modern web application for easy content management, developed with JavaScript, React, and GUI design using Figma."
longDescription: "My second project is a modern web application that I developed as part of my studies. The goal was to create a platform where users can easily and intuitively manage various types of content. I placed special emphasis on an appealing design and a user-friendly interface, which I designed using Figma. The application is built with current web technologies such as JavaScript and React, and it uses a REST API for backend communication. During development, I overcame several challenges, including implementing a secure authentication system and optimizing performance for different devices. This project helped me deepen my skills in web development and gain practical experience with modern frameworks and design tools. Overall, I am very satisfied with the result and look forward to expanding the project further and adding new features."
