shortDescription: "A modern web application for easy content management, designed with Figma and developed using React and TypeScript."
longDescription: "My third project is a modern web application that I developed as part of my studies. The main goal was to create a platform where users can manage various types of content easily and intuitively. I started by designing the user interface in Figma, focusing on a clean and user-friendly experience. The application is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing a REST API for backend communication. During development, I tackled challenges such as implementing secure authentication and optimizing performance for different devices. This project allowed me to deepen my skills in web development, UI/UX design, and working with modern frameworks. Overall, I am very satisfied with the result and look forward to expanding the project with new features."
